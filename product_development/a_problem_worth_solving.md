### Christina's Problem
  Meet Christina. She's a junior at KIPP NYC College Prep. She's got a full schedule, plays on the soccer team, and is the treasurer of her schoolâ€™s National Honors Society chapter.

  Between homework, soccer practice, and business club work, she struggles to get everything done. During the school day, she stresses about all the work she has to do for NSH. During soccer practice, she can't stop thinking about all the homework she has to get done that night. When she finally gets home at 8:00 pm she remembers the English paper due the following day. She wrote the to-do down on her hand earlier and thought she'd write it in her planner later. Her planner was at the bottom of her bag and she had to run to her next class. The reminder washed off and she totally forgot to plan for the paper.

  If she doesn't get an A on this paper, her English grade will drop and she won't be allowed to play in her soccer match on Friday.

  Christina is frustrated and tired of being in this situation.

### What Christina Does Now
 She's tried being diligent about writing her to-dos down in her school planner, but the planner is not always readily available when the teacher announces the homework at the end of class and Christina's bag is already packed. She's used her phone to track her to-dos too. Sometimes she'll write them down in her Notes app, but that doesn't let her easily keep track of any additional information. Occasionally she even writes her tasks down on her hand, but they wash away by the time she gets home and then she has to text a friend, if she doesn't forget all together. They always take forever to text back.

  She defaults back to some combination of her planner, her phone, her hand, and just trying to remember everything she has to get done in her head. She finds herself back in the same place. Last minute marathon sessions between 8:00 pm and 2:00 am. When she does start working, she is stressed about all the work she has to complete and jumps around from one task to another. The work she does is never as good as she knows it can be. Her friend told her about a time management tool called the Pomodoro Technique. She tried it and found it really helpful. But in her stressed out state, she doesn't want the additional task of timing her work and feels like she's behind and can't afford to take any breaks.
