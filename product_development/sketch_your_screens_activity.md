# Sketch Your Screens Activity

### Assignment
  Start by having all your students sketch the screen where all of the assignments will be listed. After five minutes, have each of them talk through their sketches and reasoning behind their decisions. What did they include on the page? What is their reasoning for including each item?

### Required Materials
  * Paper
  * Pens or Pencils

### Pre-Activity Setup
  Each student will need a piece of paper and pen/pencil.  They will be working independently at their tables/desks and then presenting their sketches back to their small groups.

### Goals
  Any good coder knows that before you start coding it's good practice to sketch out your idea first.  That's exactly what we are asking the students to do during this activity time.  We want them to focus on the general flow of the page and the needs of the user.
